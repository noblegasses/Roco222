### Stepper motor
*Note 1*: the example code, seen on the lecture notes, as seen here :, loops the stepping of the motor one step. By changing the duration of the delay the speed can be increased or decreased. by reversing the order of the channels the direction of the stepper can be reversed.

*Note 2*: After reviewing the lab notes and the example code I have figured out what is what based off of the logic tables seen here: The digital channels control the A or not A and B and not B parts of the table respectivley. If A is High then you have selected A if it is low then you have selected not A. The analogue channels put a one or zero in the selected channel.
