### **Design Notes**
*Note 1:* based off the notes from the previous lecture we are going to go ahead with the double coiled design. this should allow for the motor to move without starting momentum and opperate at slower speeds.
*Note 2* Our first motor design was pretty terrible. The nails weren't aligned and the holders werent parallel, resulting in a armature that wouldn't spin. There were only 60 coils resulting in a solenoid with low resistance and little strength, meaning the coil would get hot easily and spin weakly. Finally, the commutator was wrinkled and pitted making it very hard for the brushes to make contact with the armature without stopping it by digging in. We are going to take these notes into account and remake the motor differently.
*Note 3* Taking into account our observations from Note 2 we have built a new motor. It has four coils of 100 windings. it uses a screw with ball bearings to allow for more slip and smoother motion. We are printing a stand so that the parts all fit together as well as possible. we have taken steps to make the commutator as smooth as possible. the bushes will be stiff wires attatched to the base.
*Note 4* the new motor designs have a few issues that make it unsusable. The bearings have a abec rating of 5 wich means it has quite a lot of friction. while the motor moves it can't really spin. so we are going to look for some better bearings. 
*Note 5* the new bearings (taken from a fidget spinner) work. Using brushes made from a thick copper wire, and the commutator, detailed below, the motor is self-starting and appears to spin rather quickly. The coils do not get hot. One small note, due to the slightly rough contacts due to solder being used to remove the coating on the brushes, when the motor spins at high speed there can be some sparks coming off the commutator, but they do not appear to be dangerous.

### **Encoder**

the encoder disk followed a fairly budget, yet effective option, simply it is a small cardboard disk, cut from a pizza box, with a hole in the center the size of the motor shaft, and a notch in it. For the electronic side of the encoder we followed the schematics provided. Although it didn't nessisarily cause a problem I thought it was weird that the cathode and anode for the phototranistor were opposite length of the LED, but other than that it was pretty straight forward. We drilled a hole into the mount to fit the en coder.
